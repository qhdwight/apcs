Abstract
========

An abstract class cannot be directly instantiated, but can have fields and methods that a class extending it has access to.
Abstract method make it so that the extending class has to implement the body of the method.
The abstract class only defines the method signature.

Polymorphism
============

----------
| animal |-------
----------      |
    |           |
---------    -------
|  cat  |    | dog |
---------    -------
                |
             -----------
             | big dog |
             -----------

Animal cannot be instantiated since it is an abstract class.
Dog cannot be cast to Cat because they are in separate branches.

Interfaces
==========

Interfaces can only define methods to be implemented, where as abstract classes can do the same and also provide bodies.
Abstract classes can also contain constructors and field variables, where as interfaces can not.
